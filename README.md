# ASM HydraSynth NRPN mapping

A website that can send and receive MIDI NRPN Data to and from the HydraSynth by Ashun Sound Machines. Most parameters are assigned with the hope of eventually covering 100% of the instrument.  This site serves as a base
for finer grained control and sending of data to the synthesizer based on ASM's information provided, as well as monitoring the values of said parameters based on user input.
